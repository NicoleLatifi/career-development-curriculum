# Career Journal Template - 2005 Cohort

## Overview
* **What is a career journal?** The journal will help guide you through the process of discovering who you are as a new developer and how that translates into your career goals.  It’s a way to check in with yourself through self-reflection, prompts, and questions, organize your targeted job search, and remember who you met as you build a professional network.   
* **Make it your own.** Add questions and areas to reflect on each week. Just don’t forget to share all of your successes and achievements along the way! 
* **Ongoing progress checks.** Throughout the module, you'll respond to the other prompts and update your progress in your document during professional development workshops and set aside work time. 
* **Module Expectations.** A completed career journal is required for successfully passing the module. The career development team will be assessing your progress throughout the module, and you will submit it for final review in week 6. You will also include highlights from your progress in your end of module portfolio presentation. 

### Directions
1. Copy the following into your own gist or Google Doc. You'll be sharing this with the Career Development Team. 
2. At the end of week 1, you'll submit the link to your journal in a survey provided to you by Allison. Please DM her with any questions you have. 

### Mod 1 Week 1: Understanding your strengths 
1. Describe one of your strengths
* What is something you have learned to do well (list a skill)?

_Active Listening_

* What is something you know about (list some knowledge/expertise you have)?

_Customer Service_

* What is something you have a natural ability to do well (list a talent)?

_Being helpful_

* How do those combine to create a specific strength?

_I work well with diverse groups._


2. Read through your Top 4 results from Pairin
* In your own words, what do these top 4 qualities tell you about yourself?

_The results of my Pairin survey suggest that I am an analytical thinker and that I have am level-headed. I work through problems with a structured and methodical approach. I value planning and precision. I regulate my thoughts and actions. And I appreciate the overall good more than my personal impulses._
* _Top Thinking Style: Objective-Analytical_
* _Strongest Drive: Specialist_
* _Top EQ Competency: Calm, Cool & Collected_
* _Highest Virture Class: Lover of Moderation_

* Do they resonate with you? Why/why not?

_Yes, the description of these qualities resonates a lot with me. As a side note, I have found the explinations fo the enneagram personality types extremely helpful. I am an enneagram type 9 whose key motivations is "to create harmony in their environment, to avoid conflicts and tension, to preserve things as they are, to resist whatever would upset or disturb them" (https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-9). This corresponds with my pairin results._

* How do they relate to the strength you wrote about in Prompt #1?

_My pairin results relate to my strength of working well with others because I can navigate conflicts and naturally change my behavior in accordance with what will work best for others. Also, my objective thinking style helps me not take things personally when conflicts do arise._

3. Challenges with strengths
* What can make it challenging to recognize your strengths? How can you work through those challenges?

_It can be challenging to recognize my strengths because I am much more accustomed to focusing no my weaknesses. It also feels very vulnerable for me to say that I am good at something because then I feel like I have to back it up and I'm not confident that I can do that all the time. I also tend to focus on others more than myself so it is uncomfortable to self-reflective._

* Do you ever see yourself overusing certain strengths? In what circumstances would you want to use them less and amplify other strengths? How could you adjust your approach in those instances?

_I wouldn't really describe it as overusing a strength, more as downplaying weaknesses. I tend to focus more on producing quality work that speaks for itself than actually speaking._

4. Strengths in action
* Write 1-2 sentences describing how you like to work (i.e., Do you pre-plan? Do you talk through your ideas first? Do you work better with deadlines? How do you stay organized?)

_I think I use a hybrid of different working approaches. I like to just dive in and review the project so that I can evaluate how much pre-planning or talking through my ideas I will need to do. And then I can adjust my approach as I go. I often find that if I try to have an overly structured plan it ends up changing as I go._

* How could you talk about these working preferences with your project teammates? Your mentor? Your instructors?

_I think having an ongoing open discussion is most helpful. The initial discussion you have is great, but things will probably change and adjust so I think you need to keep having regular check-ins._

* What would you need to be aware of when working with people who have different strengths from you?

_I need to know their communication style and working style._

* How could your Pairin results help you better understand your everyday working preferences?

_My Pairin results help me understand that I do like to have a structured and logical approach._

5. Continued growth
* Is there any particular strength you'd like to sharpen while you're at Turing? Any area you consider a weakness that you'd like to strengthen? 

_I greatly need to work on my ability to communicate my strengths and experiences from previous work experiences. Even writing responses to these low pressure prompts is incredibilty challenging and uncomfortable for me. I do not know how to structure my thoughts and words._

* What are some steps you could take here?

_Seek out help from others. Keep working through the discomfort and not give up or feel like it's just something I'm not good at and can't improve._

* How could you be aware of progress you're making?

_Feedback from others is very helpful because it's sometimes to see progress myself._


### Mod 1 Week 2: Building Your Compass
1. [Power of self-reflection](https://medium.com/publishous/the-power-of-self-reflection-c1a654ea03a)
* What is challenging about self-reflection?

_Self-reflection is challenging because it's hard to stop and take the time to reflect when there always seems to be more pressing matters. Also, when you are able to do self-reflection, it can be challenging to have an objective view of yourself. There are often things that we rate ourselves better or worse at then we actually are._

* How can you continue to build the habit of self-reflection at Turing? 

_Generally, habits are formed by intentionly doing something on a regular basis until it becomes a habit or something that you naturally do without any or much effort. I can do this with self-reflection by intentionally asking myself if I understand the material and how I'm doing with my study habits when re-teaching lessons and with each git commit I do. These are just some hard places that seem like natural benchmarks to stop and self-reflect but self-reflection can also be an ongoing process._

2. Social identity mapping
First, create you own social identity map on a piece of paper (or [print this out](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Social%20Identity%20Map.pdf)):
* Outer ring: write words that describe your given identity

* _female_-
* _31_-
* _daughter_?
* _sister_?
* _white_+


* Middle ring: list aspects of your chosen identity

* _single mother_-
* _divorced_-
* _Coloradan_+
* _college graduate_+

* Center: write your core attributes—traits, behaviors, beliefs, values, characteristics, and skills that you think make you unique as an individual. Select things that are enduring and key to who you are.

* _introverted_?
* _caring_?
* _grit_?

After you complete your map:
* Underline the items that are important to you
* Put a + beside the items that you believe clearly demonstrate that you fit into the tech industry
* Put a - beside the items that you believe do not demonstrate that you fit into the tech industry
* Put a ? beside the items that you're unsure how they could show your ability to contribute to the tech industry

Reflect:
* What does your social identity tell you about what you already bring to the tech industry?

_I believe that my social identity can fit into the tech industry._

* What would it look like for some of your minuses or question marks to turn into pluses? In other words, how could some of these traits be assets for the tech industry?

_At times being introverted can be a plus. In group situations, introverted qualitites can work well with others._

3. Values mapping
Pull out 5 values for each bullet below from [this list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wF1afCu5KqLfDa8rLiOH9ICfIWyjWZRS5Dba7UehYMc/edit?usp=sharing):
* Always valued: accomplishment, usefulness, hard work, diligence, excellence
* Often valued: ambition, initiative, understanding, security, simplicity
* Sometimes valued: balance, altruism, generoisty, status, temperance
* Seldom valued: aesthetics, adventure, caution, self-respect, sensitivity

Reflect:
* What do these values tell you about yourself? 

_I highly value productivity and measureable success. I tend to not place as high of a value on qualities that are harder to quantify such as altruism and sensitivity._

4. Workview & Lifeview
* Summarize what good, worthwhile work means to you (Tip: this is NOT about what work you want to do but about why work matters to you):

_To me, worthwhile work means you are adding something and contributing. I also value problem solving and the sense of accomplishment and mental stimulation it gives you._

* Lifeview: summarize what you value in life; what matters to you?

_The main thing that matters to me is being able to take care of my son and be someone that he can respect and look up to. I think this is something that can be achieved through a career in the tech industry._

* Where do your views on work and life complement each other?

_I hope that I can have a career where I am able to financially provide for my son, model hard work and stability, and still be able to spend quality time with him._

* Where do they clash?

_If their is an expectation for me to have my career as a top priority, that will clash with my other priorities._

* Does one drive the other? How?

_Yes. Before having my son I really had no motivation or regard for myself. He has sparked all the motivation that I have._

### Mod 1 Week 3: Habits & Accountability Systems <a name="week-3"></a>
* Who do you want to be as a software developer? What kind of behaviors do you already have in place to be that person? What behaviors would you need to put into place? How will you do that?

_As a software developer, I want to be dependable, skilled, and collaborative. The behaviors I already have in place are I am usually punctual and deliver on what I say I'll do. I also have begun to develop my skills as well as a learning process by which to gain new skills. Finally, I work well with others and need to continue to hone my communication skills._

**Working on the 1st Law of Behavior Change: Make it Obvious**
* Bring self-awareness to your current habits by making a Habits Scorecard. Make a list of your daily habits (examples: wake up, turn off alarm, check phone, etc.) as a way to bring awareness to what you do. Then, decide how effective that habit is for you and your goal of becoming a software developer. Put a + next to habits that are effective; put a - next to habits that are not effective; put a = next to habits that are neutral.

* _Wake up and check phone_
* _Get Romin out of his crib_
* _Check phone_
* _Feed Romin_
* _Check phone_
* _Change Romin's diaper_
* _Drink some tea or coffee_
* _If driving, listen to radio or podcast_
* _Give Romin dinner_
* _Give Romin bath_
* _Give Romin bottle_
* _Put Romin to bed_
* _Straighten up_
* _Study/do homework_

* Pick 1 new habit you'd like to build and create an implementation intention following this template: "I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]." Then, stack the habit onto something you already do: "After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]." (Hint: make this highly specific and immediately actionable)

_After checking my phone when I first wake up, I will not look at my phone until our morning routine is done. I will do this by using the Forest app and "planting a tree" that will "grow" for an hour._

* Design your environment for success: what changes could you make in your space to better implement your habit? How could you remove any triggers for bad habits? How will you implement these changes?

_I think it would help to have a watch so that I have something else readily available to use to check the time besides my phone. I have an Amazon gift card that I got for my birthday that I can use to buy a wrist watch._

* Respond after a few days of this implementation: What are your results? How do you feel about this method? How will you move forward with this habit? 

_It's going to continue to be difficult to not look at my phone because it's the perfect attention grabbing device. I will keep making it a priority._

**Habits of a Software Developer**
* What do you think are the traits of a good software developer? What are they like in the workplace? What would you as a co-worker think of this person?

_Some traits of a software developer are efficiency, teamwork, and continually seeking new information._

* What are the habits that this person demonstrates to embody the identity of a software developer?

_Some habits that embody these traits are time management, empathy, and staying humble and curious._

### Mod 1 Week 4: Creating a Vision, Part I
1. Habits Reflection:
* How have you seen yourself become more aware of your habits? Have you tried implementing anything new? What have the results been? 

   _I have recently noticed that when I wake up earlier and go for a walk in the morning, I am more productive throughout the rest of my day. In order to do this, I also need to go to bed as early as possible._

2. Start Where You Are (Empathize with the user -- *you*)
* Health: how you answer “how are you”; intersection of physical, mental, and emotional health
    * How would you rate your overall health on a scale of 1-5? How do you currently make time for activities associated with your health? What is a small change you could make here to readjust your health ratings?
 
    _3.5_
    _Currently I do a fair amount of walking, eating somewhat healthy._
    _I could eat more consistently. And prioritize sleep more._
    
* Work: what you do
    * Make a short list of all the ways you work right now; How much value do each of those things bring to your life? How are those activities purposeful for you?

    _Taking care of Romin._
    _Turing projects._
    _Turing solo studying._
    
* Play: what brings you joy? Think about joy just for the pure sake of doing it; everyone benefits from this kind of play 
    * What activities do you do that bring you joy throughout an average week? In what ways could you make a small change to bring more joy into your life?
    
    _Playing with Romin._
    _Exercise for sure but I'm not making time for it._
    _Sometimes listening to music while I work/study._
    
* Love: sense of connection; who are the people who matter in your life and how is love flowing to and from you and them?
    * How does love currently show up in your life? How do you show love to others right now? What adjustments would you like to make in this area?

_Right now I don't have much free time but just giving someone even a couple minutes of 100% distraction free attention can be very benefitial. Also, dreaming with people about the future is hard now with how uncertain things like travel are._
    
* Looking back at the 4 areas, do any problems emerge that you want to begin designing solutions for?
  
 _I've always struggled with connecting with others._

3. Define your needs, problem, and insights:

Based on what you wrote about above and your group conversation, what problems have you identified that you'd like to design solutions for? What do you already about what you want for your career? What do you still need to find out? Who or what do you want to grow into by the end of the Turing program?

_I would like more experience working with others so that I can gain more confidence with it. I do not know what I want for my career. My main motivation has been financial but there are other things that are important to me._

4.  Ideate -- challenge assumptions   

When you discussed software developers with your small group, what assumptions came up about what software developers actually do? What steps could you take to challenge those assumptions and find more facts to answer the question of what developers do? In addition to what a typical software developer life could look like, what do you want yours to include?

_One thing that came up in group discussions is wondering what the differences tend to be between working for a small company and working for a large company. I can learn more about this by talking to people that are currently working in the industry._

5. Prototype -- start creating solutions

What is the basic threshold that your new career must meet after Turing? What would you hope WILL NOT happen in your future after Turing? What is your absolute, no-holds-barred, ideal dream for your future after Turing?

_I hope that I can find a job that will offer financial stability and also balance so that I can spend time with my son and have work-life balance._

5. Test –- solutions

Based on this week of reflections, write out your initial vision statement for your career:

_I don't really know what this would look like._

### Mod 1 Week 5: Creating a Vision, Part II <a name="week-5"></a>
1. Habits Reflection:
* How have you seen yourself become more aware of your habits? Have you tried implementing anything new? What have the results been?

_I have become more aware of my habits because I have such time is such a scarse resource for me. I am more aware of what I do efficiently and what are time sucks. I am spending much less time on things that are time sucks and spending more time on things that either set me up to have a productive day (i.e. taking a walk first thing in the morning) or things that save me time later (i.e. meal prepping)._

2. Design Thinking Reflection: [Cultivating Beginner's Mind](https://mindfulambition.net/beginners-mind/)

* How can beginner's mind be helpful when it comes to thinking about your career and job search? What are some habits you could put into place to cultivate beginner's mind regularly? 

_Personally, I think that beginners mindset can be helpful when thinking about my career and job search because I can be free of preconceptions. Some preconceptions that may be limiting when job searching are thinking that a certain type of job (i.e. big company, speciic industry) is what I should be seeking or avoiding._

4. Write out your top 5 strengths that you've seen in action this module; then write out the strengths of a software developer. Where do you see these lists overlapping? Where are they different?

- learn quickly
- adapt to group dynamics quickly
- methodical problem solving
- attention to detail and precision
- organized, can create a schedule, stick to it and meet deadlines

5. Write a refined vision statement here (what new things have you discovered this week to incorporate into your vision statement?):

I enjoy working with a group and helping others.
