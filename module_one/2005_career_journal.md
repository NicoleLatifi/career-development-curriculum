# Career Journal Template - 2005 Cohort

## Overview
* **What is a career journal?** The journal will help guide you through the process of discovering who you are as a new developer and how that translates into your career goals.  It’s a way to check in with yourself through self-reflection, prompts, and questions, organize your targeted job search, and remember who you met as you build a professional network.   
* **Make it your own.** Add questions and areas to reflect on each week. Just don’t forget to share all of your successes and achievements along the way! 
* **Ongoing progress checks.** Throughout the module, you'll respond to the other prompts and update your progress in your document during professional development workshops and set aside work time. 
* **Module Expectations.** A completed career journal is required for successfully passing the module. The career development team will be assessing your progress throughout the module, and you will submit it for final review in week 6. You will also include highlights from your progress in your end of module portfolio presentation. 

### Directions
1. Copy the following into your own gist or Google Doc. You'll be sharing this with the Career Development Team. 
2. At the end of week 1, you'll submit the link to your journal in a survey provided to you by Allison. Please DM her with any questions you have. 

### Mod 1 Week 1: Understanding your strengths 
1. Describe one of your strengths
* What is something you have learned to do well (list a skill)?

_Active Listening_

* What is something you know about (list some knowledge/expertise you have)?

_Customer Service_

* What is something you have a natural ability to do well (list a talent)?

_Being helpful_

* How do those combine to create a specific strength?

_I work well with diverse groups._


2. Read through your Top 4 results from Pairin
* In your own words, what do these top 4 qualities tell you about yourself?

_The results of my Pairin survey suggest that I am an analytical thinker and that I have am level-headed. I work through problems with a structured and methodical approach. I value planning and precision. I regulate my thoughts and actions. And I appreciate the overall good more than my personal impulses._
* _Top Thinking Style: Objective-Analytical_
* _Strongest Drive: Specialist_
* _Top EQ Competency: Calm, Cool & Collected_
* _Highest Virture Class: Lover of Moderation_

* Do they resonate with you? Why/why not?

_Yes, the description of these qualities resonates a lot with me. As a side note, I have found the explinations fo the enneagram personality types extremely helpful. I am an enneagram type 9 whose key motivations is "to create harmony in their environment, to avoid conflicts and tension, to preserve things as they are, to resist whatever would upset or disturb them" (https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-9). This corresponds with my pairin results._

* How do they relate to the strength you wrote about in Prompt #1?

_My pairin results relate to my strength of working well with others because I can navigate conflicts and naturally change my behavior in accordance with what will work best for others. Also, my objective thinking style helps me not take things personally when conflicts do arise._

3. Challenges with strengths
* What can make it challenging to recognize your strengths? How can you work through those challenges?

_It can be challenging to recognize my strengths because I am much more accustomed to focusing no my weaknesses. It also feels very vulnerable for me to say that I am good at something because then I feel like I have to back it up and I'm not confident that I can do that all the time. I also tend to focus on others more than myself so it is uncomfortable to self-reflective._

* Do you ever see yourself overusing certain strengths? In what circumstances would you want to use them less and amplify other strengths? How could you adjust your approach in those instances?

_I wouldn't really describe it as overusing a strength, more as downplaying weaknesses. I tend to focus more on producing quality work that speaks for itself than actually speaking._

4. Strengths in action
* Write 1-2 sentences describing how you like to work (i.e., Do you pre-plan? Do you talk through your ideas first? Do you work better with deadlines? How do you stay organized?)

_I think I use a hybrid of different working approaches. I like to just dive in and review the project so that I can evaluate how much pre-planning or talking through my ideas I will need to do. And then I can adjust my approach as I go. I often find that if I try to have an overly structured plan it ends up changing as I go._

* How could you talk about these working preferences with your project teammates? Your mentor? Your instructors?

_I think having an ongoing open discussion is most helpful. The initial discussion you have is great, but things will probably change and adjust so I think you need to keep having regular check-ins._

* What would you need to be aware of when working with people who have different strengths from you?

_I need to know their communication style and working style._

* How could your Pairin results help you better understand your everyday working preferences?

_My Pairin results help me understand that I do like to have a structured and logical approach._

5. Continued growth
* Is there any particular strength you'd like to sharpen while you're at Turing? Any area you consider a weakness that you'd like to strengthen? 

_I greatly need to work on my ability to communicate my strengths and experiences from previous work experiences. Even writing responses to these low pressure prompts is incredibilty challenging and uncomfortable for me. I do not know how to structure my thoughts and words._

* What are some steps you could take here?

_Seek out help from others. Keep working through the discomfort and not give up or feel like it's just something I'm not good at and can't improve._

* How could you be aware of progress you're making?

_Feedback from others is very helpful because it's sometimes to see progress myself._


### Mod 1 Week 2: Building Your Compass
1. [Power of self-reflection](https://medium.com/publishous/the-power-of-self-reflection-c1a654ea03a)
* What is challenging about self-reflection?

_Self-reflection is challenging because it's hard to stop and take the time to reflect when there always seems to be more pressing matters. Also, when you are able to do self-reflection, it can be challenging to have an objective view of yourself. There are often things that we rate ourselves better or worse at then we actually are._

* How can you continue to build the habit of self-reflection at Turing? 

_Generally, habits are formed by intentionly doing something on a regular basis until it becomes a habit or something that you naturally do without any or much effort. I can do this with self-reflection by intentionally asking myself if I understand the material and how I'm doing with my study habits when re-teaching lessons and with each git commit I do. These are just some hard places that seem like natural benchmarks to stop and self-reflect but self-reflection can also be an ongoing process._

2. Social identity mapping
First, create you own social identity map on a piece of paper (or [print this out](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Social%20Identity%20Map.pdf)):
* Outer ring: write words that describe your given identity

* _female_
* _31_
* _daughter_
* _sister_
* _white_

* Middle ring: list aspects of your chosen identity

* _mother_
* _Coloradan_
* _college graduate_

* Center: write your core attributes—traits, behaviors, beliefs, values, characteristics, and skills that you think make you unique as an individual. Select things that are enduring and key to who you are.

* _introverted_
* _caring_
* _grit_

After you complete your map:
* Underline the items that are important to you
* Put a + beside the items that you believe clearly demonstrate that you fit into the tech industry
* Put a - beside the items that you believe do not demonstrate that you fit into the tech industry
* Put a ? beside the items that you're unsure how they could show your ability to contribute to the tech industry

Reflect:
* What does your social identity tell you about what you already bring to the tech industry? 
* What would it look like for some of your minuses or question marks to turn into pluses? In other words, how could some of these traits be assets for the tech industry?

3. Values mapping
Pull out 5 values for each bullet below from [this list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wF1afCu5KqLfDa8rLiOH9ICfIWyjWZRS5Dba7UehYMc/edit?usp=sharing):
* Always valued:
* Often valued:
* Sometimes valued:
* Seldom valued:

Reflect:
* What do these values tell you about yourself? 

4. Workview & Lifeview
* Summarize what good, worthwhile work means to you (Tip: this is NOT about what work you want to do but about why work matters to you):
* Lifeview: summarize what you value in life; what matters to you?
* Where do your views on work and life complement each other?
* Where do they clash?
* Does one drive the other? How?
