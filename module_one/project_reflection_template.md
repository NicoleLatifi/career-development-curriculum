# Project Reflections
Use this template to keep a log of reflections on each of your projects through Mod 1, 2, 3, and 4 at Turing. Feel free to add additional questions/prompts that you want to reflect on to help you prepare for future interviews. 

## Abstract
In a few sentences, explain **what** the project was and the scope of your work. Imagine explaining your answer to a technical recruiter or a developer who you'd potentially be interviewing with.

## Overall (Choose one)
* How do you think you did working with this group compared with groups you've worked with in the past?

* If you were to work with this same group again, what is one change the group could make to work together more effectively?
What was the greatest challenge you had as a group?

* How would you describe your role in this team? How often did you interact with other team members?

## Technical (Choose one)
* What was a specific technical challenge your group faced? How did you approach this challenge? What went well? What was a struggle?

* What resources or strategies did you use when you were presented with a technical challenge?

## Reflection
* What lessons did you learn during this project? How have you applied these lessons in a recent project (or plan to)?

## Group Project Reflections
* What have you learned about the use of agile vs. waterfall in software projects?

* How did you and your group approach project management in this project (what tools did you use, how did you hold each other accountable, etc.)?

* In your team retro, how did you engage in the feedback process? What principles of feedback did you use in these conversations?

* How would you describe your ability to communicate feedback? How has this experience affected your communication skills? How do you want to improve in your ability to communicate feedback?

What was the greatest challenge you had as a group?

_I think our least effective group meetings were when we met for three hours straight and got stuck on a few things. Then when we took a break for a few hours and regrouped, we had all figured out solutions on our own. I think we could have benefited from taking a break when we realized we were stuck or maybe even switching over to working on something else (like laying out the readme or tweaking some css things) rather than just struggling through the same thing for hours._

## Technical (Choose one)
* What resources or strategies did you use when you were presented with a technical challenge?

_When we ran into technical challenges, we did independent research and seeked help from mentors and other classmates._

## Reflection
* What lessons did you learn during this project? How have you applied these lessons in a recent project (or plan to)?

_I've learned to be EXTREMELY specific when talking through code. In example, there was a time when we were setting the margin on an element in CSS and I was looking a one element and my groupmate was looking at a different element. My groupmate kept saying that the margin needed to be increased and it looked like it wasn't changing at all while I saw the margin was getting way bigger than we wanted. After several minutes we realized we were looking at different things... For the rest of the project I made sure that all group memeber were on the same page when I was talking through something._

## Group Project Reflections
* What have you learned about the use of agile vs. waterfall in software projects?

* How did you and your group approach project management in this project (what tools did you use, how did you hold each other accountable, etc.)?

_We worked through the provided iteration instructions line by line._

* In your team retro, how did you engage in the feedback process? What principles of feedback did you use in these conversations?

* How would you describe your ability to communicate feedback? How has this experience affected your communication skills? How do you want to improve in your ability to communicate feedback?
